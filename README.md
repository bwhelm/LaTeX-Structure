# LaTeX Structure

LaTeX Structure is a program that will display the structure of a LaTeX document -- table of contents and lists of footnotes, citations, labels and references, to-do items, figures, index entries, and tables. It allows searching and sorting within each list.

Selecting an item in the list will tell TeXShop.app (a standard Mac LaTeX editor) to jump to the relevant part of the corresponding document. 

Designed for my personal use (with a list of todo LaTeX commands that I use).
